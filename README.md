# Diamond Price Prediction System.

## Introduction
 This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the price of diamonds based on their physical characteristics. By analyzing various attributes such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth, the model will provide valuable insights for the diamond industry, aiding in pricing decisions and inventory management.

## Model Selection

 Several machine learning algorithms will be considered for this project, such as:

1) Linear Regression: A simple yet effective baseline model.
2) Lasso Regression: Shrinks coefficients for feature selection and interpretability.
3) Ridge Regression: Improves model stability and reduces impact of correlated features.
4) Elastic Net Regression: Balances feature selection and stability, suitable for various data scenarios.
5) Decision Trese Regression: Interpretable but prone to overfitting, requires pruning.

## Model Evaluation
 The trained model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as:

1) Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
2) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a more interpretable measure.
3) R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

## Deployment
Once a satisfactory model is developed, it can be deployed in various applications, including:

1) Diamond pricing tools: Providing real-time price estimates based on diamond characteristics.
2) Inventory management systems: Assisting in pricing and valuation of diamond inventory.
3) Fraud detection: Identifying anomalies in diamond pricing data that may indicate fraudulent activity.
